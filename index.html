  <p>COVID-19 [Coronavirus] is spreading in the whole world.
To stop the virus we need to wash our hands with soap,wear a face 
mask,do not go out when not needed to and if you go out wear a pair of
hand gloves,perfer home delivery and keep 5 feet distance.This way we
can stop Corona Virus and can also stop lockdown!
